    <h1>The Band</h1>
    <h3>We love music</h3>
    <p>
      The Local Band is a Finnish hard rock supergroup formed in 2013. The band
      got its start when Children of Bodom's Alexi Laiho and The 69 Eyes' Jussi
      69 expressed interest in playing some of their favorite songs together.
      Jussi 69 then asked Reckless Love frontman Olli Herman to join, and the
      initial line-up was rounded out by Santa Cruz's Archie Cruz.</p>
      <p>Dubbed
      "The Local Band", the group played their first show on December 27, 2013
      at the Tavastia Club in Helsinki, Finland, which was sold-out. The band
      then played at the Ruisrock festival in Turku, Finland in July 2014.
      The group initially intended to play only once a year. In August 2015,
      The Local Band once again performed at the Tavastia Club, after which they
      played for the first time in Japan at the Loud Park Festival in
      October.</p>
      <p>In December 2015, the group released an EP of seven cover
      songs entitled Locals Only - Dark Edition. The release charted at number
      20 on the Finnish Album Chart, with the track "Sunglasses at Night" also
      being released as a single. In August 2016, The Local Band played
      Nosturi in Helsinki, followed by the WaterXfest in Jyväskylä in
      September. In March 2018, the band embarked on a three date Finnish
      tour, during which Samy Elbanna of Lost Society filled in for Archie
      Cruz. In June 2018, The Local Band toured Japan and opened for
      Hollywood Vampires in Helsinki. Afterwards the group announced
      that Elbanna had replaced Cruz in the band.</p>
